# Mattermost Icebreaker Plugin
This plugin adds the ability to ask random users Icebreaker questions in a channel.

```
Mike: /icebreaker
IceBreaker Bot: Hey John! What's your favorite superhero?
John: Wtf Mike! Stop triggering this bot every 5 minutes!
```

## Why?
In COVID times it's hard to get to know your colleagues by casually chatting by the watercooler. This bot enables these type of random interactions between everyone.

## Features
* Everyone can trigger a new Icebreaker question
* Let users propose new questions, admins need to approve them before they can get asked
* Questions are stored per channel, so each channel can have their own set of questions

## Contribute
